                                showed that it could not find the address. Then I modified the line 53 to "if True" mentioned above, the connection worked quit stable and demo.ipynb notebook could pass the test shown as figure below.

                                And the "delay(100)" was added each loop since it was important for the program to run continuously. The arduino code was as Figure 11.

                            <p>This task is to record time-stamped ToF data, and send to computer through bluetooth. For testing in a convenient way, I added one more header file "TOF.h" which included two functions: one was 'set_up' which initialize and changed the address of sensors, 
                                another one was 'detect_data' which worked for distance reading for both sensors and appended into an array every time. The code in 'TOF.h' was similar to the one for sensors reading above. One more command names "TOF_TEST" was added for this task in computer side.
                                Since the time for two sensors to detect distance were different, I chose to included two time. I totally sent the command 20 times which received 20 packages of data. Each package contained the distance read by sensors and the time each sensor finished reading. I splitted
                                the data into four arrays for plotting.

                            <p>The ambient light sensor is a component of mobile devices which automatically adjusts the brightness based on surrounding light levels. High lightness under low light conditions will hurt our eyes. This sensor helps to prevent eye strain and improve the viewing experience.
                                It can be automatically controlled depends on the light envrionment. In addition, adjusting the light in different situations can save the energy. However, the accurancy is quite limited. Sometimes the strong light will cause the inaccurancy. And the cost for this sensor is 
                                high.

                            <p>The Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor is to detect heat energy in the surrounding environment. It is effective for motion detection in a wide range of applications. It works by detecting the infrared radiation which is emited by objects with a temperature.
                                It is designed to detect changes in infrared radiation. It is quite easy to install and does not require any special calibration or adjustment. It also has some limitations. The range for this sensor to detect may not cover enough areas, and it requires multiple sensors to work together. 
                                The sensitivity of PIR sensor can be affected by environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.

                            <p>The TOF sensor which we use on the Lab, work by emiting a infrared light and measuring the time it takes for the light to reflect off an object. It basically has hign accurancy and range. The long range mode can detect 4 meters furthest. However, it will be affected by 
                                highly reflective surfaces and results in inaccurancy under these situations.

                            <p>From the result above, the distance was quite accurant for white fabric, since the color and texture did not reflect any light. And the result was very stable. However, the black notebook cover could 
                                reflect the light in my room which affected the sensor detection. The error range was around 36mm. Therefore, the TOF sensor is sensitive to different colors and textures.

                            <p>Battery Discussion: the artemis and motor drivers are using seperate batteries since there are to motor drivers connected in parallel to run the car by using only one battery. Therefore, the 
                                Artemis board uses less power and current compared to motors to work.

                            <p>I tested the PWM value since 30, which my hypothesis was it should be able to run the car. But actually, my motor did not move. Then I switched it to 40, the motors started moving 
                                when I hold it, but because of the friction between tile and car, it needed more power to move. After several tests, I figured out that the lower limit PWM value of my car to go forward 
                                was 50. It could be different if the car was run on other types of ground.

                            <p>The lower limit in PWM value for on-axis turns was higher since the wheel experience more friction to make a turn. The limit value was 80.

                            <p>Task one: From the screenshot before, the frequecy it generated was 182 Hz. I think the frequency is fast enough for this motors since other sensors also need time to do the detections.
                                And if we manually configure the timers to generate a faster PWM signal, the motor would run faster and it would be benifical in running somewhere hard to run.
                            </p>
                            <p>Task Two: Since the friction is large and different in different places, I set the PWM value to 60 initially to run the car continuously. And then since the limit PWM tested above was 50, I initially set the second 
                                PWM to 40 which works well. After several experience, I found that the minimum PWM to run the car in motion was 35.
